						<h1>5 recommendations for running in the snow</h1>
						<h2></h2>
						<p>
Pick the right shoes
In such weather conditions, the right shoes will be very important. You can read about how to choose winter sneakers in our material. In general terms, we say that the best models for running in the snow are models for trail running, as well as models with metal spikes or an aggressive tread (very convenient when running in compacted and deep snow). By the way, the spikes are removable. True, some experienced runners run in asphalt sneakers, but we definitely do not recommend this! You can slip, get injured, and energy consumption during a run will be higher.

Always keep an eye on the pulse
While running in the snow, the pulse increases by about 5-20 beats, depending on the depth of the snow, as well as on the degree of your training. Therefore, consider this if it is extremely important for you to exercise in a specific heart rate zone. Try to breathe rhythmically and at the same pace, as well as deeply enough (as far as the air temperature allows). It has long been proven that running in the snow is an excellent cardio load, and winter running helps to increase endurance, as well as speed and running technique. But it is important to remember that with such a load, sweating increases, so be sure to choose high-quality equipment with moisture removal.</p>

						<h1>4 workouts that strengthen the muscles of the arms and legs</h1>
						<h2></h2>
						<p>
The best runners not only run, but also visit the gym. But if you are doing it for yourself and are not going to jump above your head, or you just do not have enough time for regular training in the gym, but you want to strengthen the muscles, there are a few exercises that can help with this. Coach from New York Charlie Atkinson offers athletes to use the four exercises in a circular training, and their advantage is that you can perform them anywhere without additional equipment.

In his approach, Atkinson focuses on the legs and arms, while the press is actively involved in the work. In these exercises, the emphasis is on strengthening the abs muscles as a stabilizer, which is useful for the spine and your posture, as well as strengthening your arms and legs. According to the trainer, these exercises can be used in various ways - both as an active workout that allows you to use as many joints as possible, and as a “finishing off” after the main training.</p>

						<h1>5 exercises to warm up before running</h1>
						<h2></h2>
						<p>Exercise 1.
Heats the hip flexors. Stand straight, feet shoulder width apart. Raise your leg so that the thigh is parallel to the floor, and lower.

Exercise 2.
Heats the extensor muscles. Stand straight, feet shoulder width apart. Bend one leg at the knee so that the heel almost reaches the buttocks, and return to the starting position.

Exercise 3.
Heats the hamstrings. Stand straight, feet shoulder width apart, and lift the leg bent at the knee so that the thigh is parallel to the floor, then straighten it.

Exercise 4.
Heats the flexor muscles of the foot. Stand straight, hands on your belt. Pull one leg forward and pull the sock towards you as much as possible, as if pushing the heel off the wall, stretch the sock and return to the starting position.

Exercise 5.
Emphasizes on the hip extensors. Stand straight, lift one leg bent at the knee up and lean forward slightly. Quickly bring the working leg back, straightening it to the knees, and again forward.</p>

						<h1>how to find running time</h1>
						<h2></h2>
						<p>Runner's diary
It doesn’t matter whether it is paper or electronic. The main thing is that it is there, and in it you can record all your affairs, figure out how much time it will take to complete them. Surely, you will notice that on certain days there are “windows”, and then you can do a run if you do not want to wake up in the morning, or donate in the evening in a friendly company. Every evening, plan and write down what you want to do tomorrow, celebrate your victories, and what caused you to feel unwell.

Record in your diary plans not only for the day, week, month in advance. Let it have a special “department” for long-term goals, for example, the schedules of marathons and competitions that you want to run.

Prioritize correctly
You can plan for tomorrow a whole list of things to do, and then get upset that not everyone has time. But why? If you can add the most important ones to the list of plans, those that cannot be postponed. Make them with a calm soul, slowly, and then put a checkmark “done” in front of them, and praise yourself. It is very motivating. Therefore, if you understand that you have sacrificed a run for several days, for example, to read your favorite book, ask yourself questions: what will happen if I don’t read today, or what is the risk that I won’t go for a run again? In which case do you lose more?

Accurately record time
You need to know exactly how much time you need on a given day to practice. For example, if you run for 30 minutes, add + 5 minutes to them for a warm-up and the same amount for a slow-down. If you have a long time span, increase the time for these steps. Also take into account the time required for hygiene procedures in the schedule of the day so as not to run to work without taking a shower, or not to be late because of this.
The specifics in the time management of a successful athlete who combines jogging with work, for example in the office, is extremely important. Here even a few minutes play a big role. In addition, if you write in the work plan that tomorrow you have 40 free minutes, then it will be much easier for you to build your training plan. When you have a specific time, you know exactly how to build a day, work, training, to do everything.</p>
